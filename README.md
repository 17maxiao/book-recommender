# GoodReads Book Recommender
We used the a book database from the site GoodReads to create a book recommender website. We built the site with Django, and to pull and parse our data in the format of a CSV file, we  used the following libraries: 

* numpy
* pandas 
* statistics

## To Run

* Download all files
* Open terminal and enter "cd recommender"
* Make sure you have django installed - if not, enter in terminal "pip install django"
* Enter the following commnds:
  * python manage.py makemigrations
  * python manage.py migrate
  * python manage.py server
* Access the website on: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
